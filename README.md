# JERT (Jertole Token) – Cryogas Energy Network

**JERT** (Jertole Token) is a **utility digital asset** powering the Cryogas Green Cold Energy Network – a chain of autonomous LNG cold-energy terminals starting from **Aktobe, Kazakhstan** and expanding across Eurasian transport hubs near **Russia and China**.

## 🌐 Project Overview

Cryogas is building a network of **off-grid LNG cold-energy terminals**:

- Each terminal uses **LNG cold-energy recovery** and **LNG micro-generation** to operate **independently from national grids**.
- The **first terminal** is being developed in **Aktobe (Kazakhstan)**.
- Further terminals are planned at key **border transport nodes** and along the **Middle Corridor** (Azerbaijan – Georgia – Kazakhstan – EU).

**JERT** is the **digital backbone** of this network:  
it enables internal settlements, access control, staking, and ecosystem participation.

  - Cold storage
  - B2B logistics services
  - LCNG fueling services
- 🔐 **Access rights**:
  - B2B zones
  - Terminal services & APIs
- 🏦 **Staking & rewards**:
  - 16% APY (3-year program)
  - Long-term ecosystem supporters
- 🌉 **Cross-terminal settlements**:
  - Internal currency between terminals in different countries
- 🤖 **On-chain automation**:
  - Smart contract–based workflows
  - Automated billing & usage tracking

## 🏗 Cryogas Terminal Network

**Phase 1 – Aktobe Terminal**

- Location: **Aktobe, Kazakhstan**  
- Features:
  - LNG cold-energy recovery
  - Cold storage and logistics hub
  - LCNG station
  - Autonomous power generation (LNG micro-grid)

**Future Phases**

- Border nodes near **Russia and China**
- Terminals along the **Middle Corridor** (AZ–GE–KZ)
- Integration with **EU cold-chain** and LNG hubs

## 📈 Economic Model (High-Level)

Cryogas terminals generate revenue from:

- Cold storage services  
- B2B logistics and handling  
- LCNG fueling  
- Digital B2B services (access, APIs, data)  

JERT is integrated as:

- Internal settlement asset  
- Staking reward mechanism  
- Access/payment layer for services  

A simplified projection (illustrative):

- ROI grows stepwise as terminals are added and utilization increases.
- Staking yields (16% APY, 3-year lock) are rewarded in JERT.
