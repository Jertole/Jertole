🌐 Project Overview

Cryogas KZ is building a network of **off-grid LNG cold-energy terminals**:

- Each terminal uses **LNG cold-energy recovery** and **LNG micro-generation** to operate **independently from national grids**.
- The **first terminal** is being developed in **Aktobe (Kazakhstan)**.
- Further terminals are planned at key **border transport nodes** and along the **Middle Corridor** (Azerbaijan – Georgia – Kazakhstan – EU).

**JERT** is the **digital backbone** of this network:  
It enables internal settlements, access control, staking, and ecosystem participation.
