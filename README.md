### Enabling the Green Cold Energy Network Across Eurasia

JERT is the official **utility token of Cryogas Kazakhstan**, powering access to LNG-based cold-energy terminals, LCNG infrastructure, multimodal logistics and digital services along the **Middle Corridor**.

This repository hosts the **public GitHub website** of JERT, including token overview, utility model, documentation, and SVG-based animations illustrating Eurasian trade flows.

## 🚀 What is JERT?

**JERT is a utility token**, not a security.  
It provides access to Cryogas services and infrastructure:

- Cold Energy Terminals (freezing, storage, B2B cold logistics)  
- LNG → Cold Energy recovery modules  
- LCNG fuelling stations  
- Multimodal logistics services (rail, container, reefer)  
- Digital booking & API connectivity  
- Partner service integrations

JERT follows the AIFC-aligned digital asset framework and is listed in the ecosystem documentation of the **Ministry of Digital Development of Kazakhstan (MDD RK)**.

## 🌍 Middle Corridor — Core of the JERT Utility Network

The Cryogas terminal network expands along the **Middle Corridor**:

**EU → Baku (AZ) → Kazakhstan → China → Asia → back to Kazakhstan/EU**

The GitHub site includes a custom animated SVG showing real-time directional flows:

- Forward flow Europe → Caucasus → Kazakhstan → China  
- Return flow via Asia → Kazakhstan → Europe  

This loop illustrates the physical logistics backbone behind JERT’s utility.
